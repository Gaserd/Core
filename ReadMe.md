# Trading Strategies Based on Debut/Community Edition

Debut is an ecosystem for developing and launching trading strategies. An analogue of the well-known `ZenBot`, but with much more flexible possibilities for constructing strategies. All you need to do is come up with and describe the entry points to the market and connect the necessary [plugins](https://github.com/debut-js/Plugins) to work. Everything else is a matter of technology: **genetic algorithms** - will help you choose the most effective parameters for the strategy (period, stops, and others), **ticker selection module** - will help you find an asset suitable for the strategy (token or share), on which it will work best.

Debut is based on the architecture of the core and add-on plugins that allow flexible customization of any solutions. The main goal of the entire Debut ecosystem is to simplify the process of creating and launching working trading robots on various exchanges.

## Community edition
We believe in the power of the community! That is why we decided to publish the project. The community version is free, but it has some limitations in commercial use (income from trading startups is not commerce), as well as technical differences in testing strategies. Join the community, join **[developer chat](https://t.me/joinchat/Acu2sbLIy_c0OWIy)**

## Enterprise edition 15$ per month
Enterprise version is a ready-made set of tools for "big guys", for those who are engaged in trade services or create strategies professionally. Everything is here! And this is all ready to work for you and to increase the speed of your development.
